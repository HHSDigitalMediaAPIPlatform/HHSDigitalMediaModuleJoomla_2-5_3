## General Information
This is a Joomla module that can be used to search and embed HHS Digital Media content.  It has been built and tested on Joomla 2.5.19 and 3.2.3.  It is based on the pure HTML & Javascript module found [Here](https://github.com/HHSDigitalMediaAPIPlatform/HHSDigitalMediaModuleHTML).

## Installation & Setup
Install the /install/mod_content_synd.zip file like you would install any other Joomla module.  Once installed you should find a new module type called *HHS Digital Media Syndication*.

## Use
Create a new module of type *HHS Digital Media Syndication* on the Joomla admin site.  In the module editor form start by selecting a Source for the content.  That will populate supported media types and topics from that source.  Use the *From Date*, *Media Types*, and *Topics* fields to filter the list of available titles.  Select a title to see a preview of the syndicated content.  There are advanced settings controlling the display of the content.  Any advanced settings that affect the title selected will cause the preview to refresh.
